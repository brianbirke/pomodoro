Pomodoro - reach you next break
----------------------------------------------

This is a very simple timer - running 25 minuttes,
and then play a sound. 

Assuming you already have nix installed ( https://nixos.org )

just run: 

    > nix run github:brianbirke/pomodoro
    
from you faworite linux shell

starting working....


The idea is something like this: 

 - work 25 minuttes
 - pause 5 minuttes
 - work 25 minuttes
 - pause 5 minuttes
